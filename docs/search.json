Some are very application specific and require specialized programs to open. For example, consider DICOM files that are used to store and manipulate radiology data. Luckily, in bioinformatics we tend to deal mainly with simple, plain text files, most often. Plain text files are typically designed to be both human and machine-readable. If you have the choice of saving any data, you should know that some formats will make your life easier. Certain file formats like TXT, CSV, TSV, JSON, and YAML are standard plain text file formats that are easy to share and easy to open and manipulate. Because of this, you should prefer to store your data in machine-readable formats. Avoid .xlsx files for storing data. Prefer TXT, CSV, TSV, JSON, YAML, and HDF5.\nIf you have very large text files then you can use compression utilities to save space. Most bioinformatics software is designed to work well with gzip compressed data. gzip is a relatively old compression format. You could also consider using xz as a means to compress your data - just know that xz compression is less supported across tools.",

    "text": "More on filenames\nIt cannot be stressed enough how important filenames can be for an analysis. To get the most out of your files and to avoid catastrpohic failures, you should stick to some basic principles for naming files. First, use consistent and unique identifiers across all files that you generate for an experiment. For example, if you’re conducting a study that has both RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data performed on the same subjects, don’t name the files from the RNA-seq experiment subject1.fq.fz and the files from the ATAC-seq experiment control_subject1.fq.gz if they refer to the same sample. For small projects, it’s fairly easy to create consistent and unique IDs for each subject. For large projects unique random IDs can be used.\nFor example, the following filenames would be bad:\nsubject1-control_at_96hr1.txt\ns1_ctl-at-4days_2.txt\ns2TRT4d1.txt\nsbj2_Treatment_4_Days_Replicate_2.txt\nInstead, look at these filenames.\nsubject1_control_4days_rep1.txt\nsubject1_control_4days_rep2.txt\nsubject2_treatment_4days_rep1.txt\nsubject2_treatment_4days_rep2.txt\nThese are better. Why are they better? They are consistent. The delimiter is consistent between the words (“_“) and each of the words represents something meaningful about the sample. These filenames also do not contain any spaces and can easily be parsed automatically.\nFile naming best practices also apply to naming executable scripts. The name of the file should describe the function of the script. For example,\n01_align_with_STAR.sh\nis better than simply naming the file\n01_script.sh\nPro-tip\nOne easy way to create unique random IDs for a large project is to concatenate descriptions and take the SHA/MDA5 hashsum.\necho \"subject1_control_4days_rep1\" | sha256\n# 57f458a294542b2ed6ac14ca64d3c8e4599eed7a\n\necho \"subject1_control_4days_rep2\" | shasum\n# b6ea9d729e57cce68b37de390d56c542bc17dea6",

    "section": "Create analysis friendly data - tidy data",
    "text": "Create analysis friendly data - tidy data\nThe term tidy data was defined by Hadley Wickham to describe data which is amenable to downstream analysis. Most people are familiar with performing a quick and dirty data analysis in a program like Excel. You may have also used some of Excel’s fancy features for coloring cells, adding bold and underlines to text, and formatting cells with other decorations. All of this tends to just be extra fluff. If you format you data properly then it will be much easier to perform downstream analysis on and will not require the use of extra decorations. This is true even in Excel!\nTo conform to the requirements of being tidy, the data should follow some simple principles:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\nDon’t cram two variables into one value. e.g. “male_treated”.\nDon’t embed units into data. e.g. “3.4kg”. Instead, put in column name e.g. “weight_kg” = 3.4\n\n\n\nOnce your data is in this format, it can easily be read into downstream programs like R, or parsed with command line text editing programs like sed.\nThe iris dataset in R provides a classic example of this format\n\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nPro-tip\ndata.frame like objects can be stored and retrieved efficiently using the Apache Arrow format instead of CSV files:\ndf &lt;- arrow::read_parquet(\"path/to/file.parquet\")\narrow::write_parquet(df, \"path/to/different_file.parquet\")\nsee R arrow for more details.

For example, large/sparse matrices, geo-spatial data, R objects, etc.the lesson here is to store data in the format that is most appropriate for the data. For example, don’t convert a matrix to a long format and save as a tsv file! Save it as an .rds file instead. Large matrices can also be efficiently stored as HDF5 files. Sparse matrices can be saved and accessed eficiently using the Matrix package in R. And if you are accessing the same data often, consider storing as a SQLite database and accessing with dbplyr or sqlalchemy in Python. The main point is don’t force data into a format that you’re familiar with only because you’re familiar with that format. This will often lead to large file sizes and inefficient performance.",

In bioinformatics, it’s common to get data from a sequencing facility with incomprehensible filenames. Don’t fall victim to the temptation of changing these filenames! Instead, it’s much better to keep the filenames exactly how they were sent to you and simply create a spreadsheet that maps the files to their metadata. In the case of a sample mix-up, it’s much easier to make a change to a row in a spreadsheet then to track down all of the filenames that you changed and ensure they’re correctly modified.\nOnce you have your raw data, you don’t want the raw data to change in any way that is not documented by code. To ensure this, you can consider changing file permissions to make the file immutable (unchangable). Using bash, you can change file permissions with:\nchattr +i myfile.txt\nIf you’re using Excel for data analysis, lock the spreadsheet with the raw data and only make references to this sheet when performing calculations.",

Coming up with a consistent and generalizable structure can be challenging at first but some general guidelines are presented here and here\nFirst of all, when beginning a new project, you should have some way of naming your projects. One good way of naming projects is to each project a descriptive name and append the date the project was started. For example, brca_rnaseq_2023-11-09/ is better than rnaseq_data/. In six months when a collaborator wants their old BRCA data re-analyzed you’ll thank yourself for timestamping the project folder and giving it a descriptive name.\nMy personal structure for every project looks like:\nyyyymmdd_project-name/\n├── data\n├── doc\n├── README\n├── results\n│   ├── data-files\n│   ├── figures\n│   └── rds-files\n└── scripts\n\n\nPrefixing the project directory with the ISO date allows for easy sorting by date\na README text file is present at the top level of the directory with a short description about the project and any notes or updates\ndata/ should contain soft links to any raw data or the results of downloading data from an external source\ndoc/ contains metadata documents about the samples or other metadata information about the experiment\nresults/ contains only data generated within the project. It has sub-directories for figures/, data-files/ and rds-files/. If you have a longer or more complicated analysis then add sub-directories indicating which script generated the results.\nscripts/ contains all analysis scripts numbered in their order of execution.

Unix shells provide an interface for interacting with Unix-like (Mac OS, Linux, etc.) operating systems and a scripting language for controlling the system. The Unix philosopy is a set of software engineering norms and concepts that guide how the tools of the Unix shell interact with one another. Learning a few of these command line tools, and how they can be strung together into what are called “pipes”, is a powerful skill for developing quick and composable bioinformatics programs. Here, we’ll describe some essential commands to get you started using the command line.\nFirst, you’ll have to open the Terminal application. If you’re on Mac OS, the quickest way to access your terminal is: “command + space”, typing “terminal” and pressing Enter. On Windows, you’ll have to install Windows Subsystem for Linux which will allow you to interact with a (default) Ubuntu OS.\nOnce you’ve opened the terminal app, you’re ready to start typing commands at the command line.",

    "text": "Introduction to programming in R\nThere are tons of great resources for learning R. R for Data Science is probably the most popular resource for new useRs to get up to speed with slicing and dicing data in R. The R for Data Science book, however, is taught from the perspective of the Tidyverse. The Tidyverse is an opinionated set of packages and functions that help users perform data manipulations primarily on data.frames. While these packages and functions can be great for experienced users by providing ergonomic and consistent interfaces for data.frame manipulation, it is my personal belief that new users should first learn the base language, especially if their goal is to perform bioinformatics analysis.\nBioinformatics tools rely heavily on subsetting and matrix manipulations. In my experience, users who start learning R using only function from the Tidyverse have a difficult time understanding matrix manipulations and subsetting operations common in bioinformatics workflows. This becomes especially important when using SummarizedExperiments - the backbone of many bioinformatics data structures in R.\nFor this reason, we’re going to focus on learning R from the ground up using functions that exist primarily in the base language. A great resource for learning base R quickly is Norm Matloff’s fasteR which can be found here.",

    "text": "Subsetting in R\nYou may have only ever encountered R from the perspective of the tidyverse. tidyverse functions provide useful abstractions for munging tidy data however, most genomics data is often best represented and operated on as matrices. Keeping your data in matrix format can provide many benefits as far as speed and code clarity, which in turn helps to ensure correctness. You can think of matrices as just fancy 2D versions of vectors. So what are vectors?\nVectors are the main building blocks of most R analyses. Whenever you use the c() function (‘concatenate’), like: x &lt;- c('a', 'b', 'c') you’re creating a vector. Vectors hold R objects and are the building block of more complex structures in R.\nNOTE: the following is heavily inspired by Norm Matloff’s excellent fasteR tutorial. Take a look there to get a brief and concise overview base R. You should also check out the first few chapters of Hadley Wickham’s amazing book Advanced R. The first edition contains some more information on base R.\n\nSubsetting vectors\nBelow, we’ll use the built-in R constant called LETTERS. The LETTERS vector is simply a ‘list’ of all uppercase letters in the Roman alphabet.\n\nLETTERS\n\n [1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" \"F\" \"G\" \"H\" \"I\" \"J\" \"K\" \"L\" \"M\" \"N\" \"O\" \"P\" \"Q\" \"R\" \"S\"\n[20] \"T\" \"U\" \"V\" \"W\" \"X\" \"Y\" \"Z\"\n\n\nWe can subset the vector by position. For example, to get the 3rd letter we use the [ operator and the position we want to extract.\n\nLETTERS[3]\n\n[1] \"C\"\n\n\nWe can also use a range of positions. The notation 3:7 is a shortcut that generates the numbers, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nLETTERS[3:7]\n\n[1] \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" \"F\" \"G\"\n\n\nWe don’t have to select sequential elements either. We can extract elements by using another vector of positions.\n\nLETTERS[c(7, 5, 14, 14, 1, 18, 15)]\n\n[1] \"G\" \"E\" \"N\" \"N\" \"A\" \"R\" \"O\"\n\n\nVectors become really powerful when we start combining them with logical operations. R supports all of the usual logical and comparison operators you can expect from a programming language, &lt;, &gt;, ==, !=, &lt;=, &gt;=, %in%, & and |.\n\nmy_favorite_letters &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\n\n# See that this produces a logical vector of (TRUE/FALSE) values\n# TRUE when LETTERS is one of my_favorite_letters and FALSE otherwise\nLETTERS %in% my_favorite_letters\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[25] FALSE FALSE\n\n# We can use that same expression to filter the vector\nLETTERS[LETTERS %in% my_favorite_letters]\n\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\"\n\n\nThis same kind of subsetting works on vectors that contain numeric data as well. For example, we can filter the measurements of annual flow of water through the Nile river like so:\nNile is another built-in dataset\n\n# Any values strictly greater than 1200\nNile[Nile &gt; 1200]\n\n[1] 1210 1230 1370 1210 1250 1260 1220\n\n# Any even number - `%%` is the modulus operator\nNile[Nile %% 2 == 0]\n\n [1] 1120 1160 1210 1160 1160 1230 1370 1140 1110  994 1020  960 1180  958 1140\n[16] 1100 1210 1150 1250 1260 1220 1030 1100  774  840  874  694  940  916  692\n[31] 1020 1050  726  456  824  702 1120 1100  832  764  768  864  862  698  744\n[46]  796 1040  944  984  822 1010  676  846  812  742 1040  860  874  848  890\n[61]  744  838 1050  918  986 1020  906 1170  912  746  718  714  740\n\n\nAt this point it’s important to take a step back and appreciate what R is doing. Each of the comparison operators that we used above is vectorized. This means that the comparison is applied to all elements of the vector at one time. If you’re used to a programming language like Python this might seem foreign at first. In Python, you would have to write a list comprehension to filter observations from a list that meet a certain condition. For example, [x for x in Nile if x &gt; 1200]. However in R, most functions and operators are vectorized allowing us to do things like Nile &gt; 1200 and have the comparison applied to all of the elements of the vector automatically.\n\n\nSubsetting data.frames\nBut these are just one dimensional vectors. In R, we usually deal with data.frames (tibbles for you tidyverse folks) and matrices. Lucky for us, the subsetting operations we learned for vectors work the same way for data.frames and matrices.\nLet’s take a look at the built-in ToothGrowth dataset. The data consists of the length of odontoblasts in 60 guinea pigs receiving one of three levels of vitamin C by one of two delivery methods.\n\nhead(ToothGrowth)\n\n   len supp dose\n1  4.2   VC  0.5\n2 11.5   VC  0.5\n3  7.3   VC  0.5\n4  5.8   VC  0.5\n5  6.4   VC  0.5\n6 10.0   VC  0.5\n\n\nThe dollar sign $ is used to extract an individual column from the data.frame, which is just a vector.\n\nhead(ToothGrowth$len)\n\n[1]  4.2 11.5  7.3  5.8  6.4 10.0\n\n\nWe can also use the [[ to get the same thing. Double-brackets come in handy when your columns are not valid R names since $ only works when columns are valid names.\n\nhead(ToothGrowth[[\"len\"]])\n\n[1]  4.2 11.5  7.3  5.8  6.4 10.0\n\n\nWhen subsetting a data.frame in base R, the general scheme is:\ndf[the rows you want, the columns you want]\nSo in order to get the 5th row of the first column we could do:\n\nToothGrowth[5, 1]\n\n[1] 6.4\n\n\nAgain, we can combine this kind of thinking to extract rows and columns matching logical conditions. For example, if we want to get all of the animals administered orange juice (‘OJ’)\n\nToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == \"OJ\", ]\n\n    len supp dose\n31 15.2   OJ  0.5\n32 21.5   OJ  0.5\n33 17.6   OJ  0.5\n34  9.7   OJ  0.5\n35 14.5   OJ  0.5\n36 10.0   OJ  0.5\n37  8.2   OJ  0.5\n38  9.4   OJ  0.5\n39 16.5   OJ  0.5\n40  9.7   OJ  0.5\n41 19.7   OJ  1.0\n42 23.3   OJ  1.0\n43 23.6   OJ  1.0\n44 26.4   OJ  1.0\n45 20.0   OJ  1.0\n46 25.2   OJ  1.0\n47 25.8   OJ  1.0\n48 21.2   OJ  1.0\n49 14.5   OJ  1.0\n50 27.3   OJ  1.0\n51 25.5   OJ  2.0\n52 26.4   OJ  2.0\n53 22.4   OJ  2.0\n54 24.5   OJ  2.0\n55 24.8   OJ  2.0\n56 30.9   OJ  2.0\n57 26.4   OJ  2.0\n58 27.3   OJ  2.0\n59 29.4   OJ  2.0\n60 23.0   OJ  2.0\n\n\nWe can also combine logical statements. For example, to get all of the rows for animals administered orange juice and with odontoblast length (‘len’) less than 10.\n\nToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == \"OJ\" & ToothGrowth$len &lt; 10, ]\n\n   len supp dose\n34 9.7   OJ  0.5\n37 8.2   OJ  0.5\n38 9.4   OJ  0.5\n40 9.7   OJ  0.5\n\n# We can also use the bracket notation to select rows and columns at the same time\n# Although this gets a little difficult to read\nToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == \"OJ\" & ToothGrowth$len &lt; 10, c(\"len\", \"supp\")]\n\n   len supp\n34 9.7   OJ\n37 8.2   OJ\n38 9.4   OJ\n40 9.7   OJ\n\n\nIt gets annoying typing ToothGrowth every time we want to subset the data.frame. Base R has a very useful function called subset() that can help us type less. subset() essentially ‘looks inside’ the data.frame for the given columns and evaluates the expression without having to explicitly tell R where to find the columns. Think of it like dplyr::filter(), if you are familiar with that function.\n\nsubset(ToothGrowth, supp == \"OJ\" & len &lt; 10)\n\n   len supp dose\n34 9.7   OJ  0.5\n37 8.2   OJ  0.5\n38 9.4   OJ  0.5\n40 9.7   OJ  0.5\n\n\n\n\nSubsetting Lists\nAnother data structure to be aware of, which is used frequently, is the List. We’ve actually already encountered Lists above. data.frames are really just Lists where each vector contains the same data type and all List elements are the same length.\nWe can create a List in R using the list() function. Notice how each list element has a name and can contain a different type of data and number of data elements\n\nl &lt;- list(\n  element1 = c(1, 10, 12, 3, 6, 12, 13, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7),\n  element2 = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n  element3 = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),\n  element4 = c(0.001, 0.05, 0.86, 1.098, 345.0)\n)\n\nLists can be tricky at first. To extract the data from a particular list element you can use the [[ or the $ (as in the case of data.frames above). Like vectors, you can use either the index or the name of the element you wish to extract.\n\nl[[1]]\n\n [1]  1 10 12  3  6 12 13  2  5  6  3  7\n\nl[[\"element1\"]]\n\n [1]  1 10 12  3  6 12 13  2  5  6  3  7\n\nl$element1\n\n [1]  1 10 12  3  6 12 13  2  5  6  3  7\n\n\nWhat is returned if you only use the single bracket [?\n\nl[1]\n\n$element1\n [1]  1 10 12  3  6 12 13  2  5  6  3  7\n\n\nYou get another List, but now with a single element. This behavior might seem unintuitive at first, but it can be very useful for creating new lists.\n\nnumeric_l &lt;- l[c(1, 4)]\n\n\n\nSubsetting matrices\nMatrices behave much like data.frames but unlike data.frames matrices can only contain one type of data. This might sound like a limitation at first but you’ll soon come to realize that matrices are very powerful (and fast) to work with in R.\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Create some random data that looks like methylation values\n(m &lt;- matrix(\n  data = runif(6 * 10),\n  ncol = 6,\n  dimnames = list(\n    paste0(\"CpG.\", 1:10),\n    paste0(\"Sample\", 1:6)\n  )\n))\n\n         Sample1    Sample2   Sample3    Sample4   Sample5    Sample6\nCpG.1  0.2875775 0.95683335 0.8895393 0.96302423 0.1428000 0.04583117\nCpG.2  0.7883051 0.45333416 0.6928034 0.90229905 0.4145463 0.44220007\nCpG.3  0.4089769 0.67757064 0.6405068 0.69070528 0.4137243 0.79892485\nCpG.4  0.8830174 0.57263340 0.9942698 0.79546742 0.3688455 0.12189926\nCpG.5  0.9404673 0.10292468 0.6557058 0.02461368 0.1524447 0.56094798\nCpG.6  0.0455565 0.89982497 0.7085305 0.47779597 0.1388061 0.20653139\nCpG.7  0.5281055 0.24608773 0.5440660 0.75845954 0.2330341 0.12753165\nCpG.8  0.8924190 0.04205953 0.5941420 0.21640794 0.4659625 0.75330786\nCpG.9  0.5514350 0.32792072 0.2891597 0.31818101 0.2659726 0.89504536\nCpG.10 0.4566147 0.95450365 0.1471136 0.23162579 0.8578277 0.37446278\n\n\nIf we want to extract the value for CpG.3 for Sample3\n\nm[3, 3]\n\n[1] 0.6405068\n\n\nOr all values of CpG.3 for every sample\n\nm[3, ]\n\n  Sample1   Sample2   Sample3   Sample4   Sample5   Sample6 \n0.4089769 0.6775706 0.6405068 0.6907053 0.4137243 0.7989248 \n\n# Or refer to the row by it's name\nm[\"CpG.3\", ]\n\n  Sample1   Sample2   Sample3   Sample4   Sample5   Sample6 \n0.4089769 0.6775706 0.6405068 0.6907053 0.4137243 0.7989248 \n\n\nOr all CpGs for Sample3\n\nm[, 3]\n\n    CpG.1     CpG.2     CpG.3     CpG.4     CpG.5     CpG.6     CpG.7     CpG.8 \n0.8895393 0.6928034 0.6405068 0.9942698 0.6557058 0.7085305 0.5440660 0.5941420 \n    CpG.9    CpG.10 \n0.2891597 0.1471136 \n\n# Or refer to the column by it's name\nm[, \"Sample3\"]\n\n    CpG.1     CpG.2     CpG.3     CpG.4     CpG.5     CpG.6     CpG.7     CpG.8 \n0.8895393 0.6928034 0.6405068 0.9942698 0.6557058 0.7085305 0.5440660 0.5941420 \n    CpG.9    CpG.10 \n0.2891597 0.1471136 \n\n\nWe can also apply a mask to the entire matrix at once. For example, the following will mark any value that is greater than 0.5 with TRUE\n\nm &gt; 0.5\n\n       Sample1 Sample2 Sample3 Sample4 Sample5 Sample6\nCpG.1    FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE\nCpG.2     TRUE   FALSE    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE\nCpG.3    FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE    TRUE\nCpG.4     TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE\nCpG.5     TRUE   FALSE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE    TRUE\nCpG.6    FALSE    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE\nCpG.7     TRUE   FALSE    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE\nCpG.8     TRUE   FALSE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE    TRUE\nCpG.9     TRUE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE    TRUE\nCpG.10   FALSE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE    TRUE   FALSE\n\n\nWe can use this kind of masking to filter rows of the matrix using some very helpful base R functions that operate on matrices. For example, to get only those CpGs where 3 or more samples have a value &gt; 0.5 we can use the rowSums() like so:\n\nm[rowSums(m &gt; 0.5) &gt; 3, ]\n\n        Sample1   Sample2   Sample3   Sample4   Sample5   Sample6\nCpG.3 0.4089769 0.6775706 0.6405068 0.6907053 0.4137243 0.7989248\nCpG.4 0.8830174 0.5726334 0.9942698 0.7954674 0.3688455 0.1218993\n\n\nThis pattern is very common when dealing with sequencing data. Base R functions like rowSums() and colMeans() are specialized to operate over matrices and are the most efficient way to summarize matrix data. The R package matrixStats also contains highly optimized functions for operating on matrices.\nCompare the above to the tidy solution given the same matrix.\n\ntidyr::as_tibble(m, rownames = \"CpG\") |&gt;\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(!CpG, names_to = \"SampleName\", values_to = \"beta\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(CpG) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(n = sum(beta &gt; 0.5)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(n &gt; 3) |&gt;\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = CpG, names_from = \"SampleName\", values_from = \"beta\") |&gt;\n  tibble::column_to_rownames(var = \"CpG\") |&gt;\n  data.matrix()\n\n        Sample1   Sample2   Sample3   Sample4   Sample5   Sample6\nCpG.3 0.4089769 0.6775706 0.6405068 0.6907053 0.4137243 0.7989248\nCpG.4 0.8830174 0.5726334 0.9942698 0.7954674 0.3688455 0.1218993\n\n\nThere’s probably some kind of tidy solution using across() that I’m missing but this is how most of the tidy code in the wild that I have seen looks",

Hmsic::describe() and skimr::skim() are two standouts.\nOne of the most basic ways to get an idea of the data is to summarize each variable. There are a few functions we can use to get summaries of the data. The table() function will count the number of occurrences of each type in a vector.\nFor example, how many observations of each species of penguin are in the dataset?\n\ntable(penguins$Species)\n\n\n      Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) \n                                      152 \nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) \n                                       68 \n        Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) \n                                      124 \n\n\nR also provides the typical summary functions that you would expect from a statistical programming language such as mean(), median(), min(), and max(), and length().\nFor example, what is the mean flipper length?\n\nmean(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm.)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nOn no! This returned NA but there is clearly data in this column. What happened? Missing data is commonly observed across all data domains. NAs simply represent unknown values in this context and it’s impossible to know how to take the mean of a value that’s known with a value that’s unknown. It is for this reason that many R functions have an argument called na.rm=. Setting na.rm=TRUE in these functions tells R to ignore the NA values.\n\nmean(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm., na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 200.9152\n\n\nNow we can see that the mean flipper length is ~200 mm across all observations in the dataset. Another useful function is summary(). Running summary() on a numeric vector returns a lot of useful information.\n\nsummary(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm., na.rm = TRUE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n  172.0   190.0   197.0   200.9   213.0   231.0       2 \n\n\nFinally, if you are using and IDE like Rstudio or Positron you can run the View() function on your data.frame. This will bring up an interactive data viewer.\n\n\nSplitting data\nYou may have noticed above that we computed the mean flipper length across all species of penguins. But do all species have the same mean? A common pattern in R is called “split-apply-combine”. This pattern means, split the data into groups you’re interested in, apply a function to each of those groups, and combine the results. One such function that performs this operation is called tapply(). tapply() will split the data by a given variable into groups and apply a function to each group.\nFor example, to find the mean flipper length for each species we could use\n\ntapply(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm., penguins$Species, mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n      Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) \n                                 189.9536 \nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) \n                                 195.8235 \n        Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) \n                                 217.1870 \n\n\nThe basic format of the tapply() function is\n\ntapply(\"data to split\", \"what to split by\", \"what to compute\")\n\nSplitting can also by applied directly to data.frames using the split() function. Let’s say we wanted to split the penguins data.frame into one data.frame for each species. We can use the split() function for this purpose.\n\nby_species &lt;- split(penguins, f = penguins$Species)\n\nThis function returns a list of data.frames, one for each species in the original data.frame. Use names(by_species) to see what each list element is named. To extract the first data.frame from this list, which contains Adelie penguin data only, we can subset the list of data.frames.\n\nadelie &lt;- by_species[[1]]\n\nPerforming operations on lists is such a common task in R that a function exists specifically to apply functions to list elements. This function is called lapply(). lapply() takes a list and a function and applies that function to each list element. The lapply() function returns the results as a list. We’ll learn more about this later in the functional programming section.\nFor example, to see how many rows are in each of the data.frames in the “by_species” list:\n\nlapply(by_species, nrow)\n\n$`Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)`\n[1] 152\n\n$`Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)`\n[1] 68\n\n$`Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)`\n[1] 124\n\n\n\n\nPlotting data\nData cleaning and data visualization go hand-in-hand. To effectively clean data, you should be examining the changes you’re making in real time. Base R actually has very powerful graphics capabilities for quickly visualizing data. Packages like ggplot2 and lattice provide powerful alternatives to base R plots. We’ll cover ggplot2 later. For now, base R plotting can provide all we need for exploratory analyses.\nOne of the most useful plots for numeric data is a histogram. Histograms bin the data and plot how many occurrences of a particular bin are present. This plot allows you to get an idea of the numeric summary of a variable. To plot a histogram of a numeric variable we can use the hist() function.\n\nhist(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram has a few arguments we can use to adjust the plot. Use ?hist() to see the full list. Below, we can adjust the axes to be more informative and modify the number of bins we’re computing.\n\nhist(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm., \n     breaks = 30,\n     main = \"Flipper Length of All Palmer Penguins\", \n     xlab = \"Flipper Length (mm)\",\n     ylab = \"Count\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution appears to be bimodal. Is this because there are different species present in this plot? We can check by applying the hist() function to each of the groups using the list of data.frames from above.\n\n# Adelie penguins \nhist(by_species[[1]]$Flipper.Length..mm., \n     breaks = 20, \n     main = \"Adelie\", \n     xlab = \"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Chinstrap penguins\nhist(by_species[[2]]$Flipper.Length..mm., \n     breaks = 20, \n     main = \"Chinstrap\", \n     xlab = \"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Gentoo penguins\nhist(by_species[[3]]$Flipper.Length..mm., \n     breaks = 20, \n     main = \"Gentoo\", \n     xlab = \"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms are useful for plotting the distribution of a single numeric variable. Often, we wish to see how two variables are related. The plot() function provides a way to create a scatter plot of two variables against each other on the same plot. For example, to plot the culmen length vs the culmen depth:\n\nplot(x = penguins$Culmen.Length..mm., \n     y = penguins$Culmen.Depth..mm.,\n     xlab = \"Culmen Length (mm)\",\n     ylab = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\",\n     main = \"Relationship between culmen length and depth\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, these data points seem to be split by the different species of penguins present in the dataset. We can color these points using an additional variable in the call to the plot() function.\n\nplot(x = penguins$Culmen.Length..mm., \n     y = penguins$Culmen.Depth..mm.,\n     col = factor(penguins$Species),\n     xlab = \"Culmen Length (mm)\",\n     ylab = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\",\n     main = \"Relationship between culmen length and depth\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that we did something special to that vector of species. We wrapped it in the factor() function. In R, factors are used when we have categorical values. R uses factors to represent the different levels of each category. It may not seem important now, but factors are very useful for statistical analysis. We’ll build on this topic shortly.\nThe plot() function is very versatile. You can use it to create line plots as well, to show trends of variables over time. Here is a contrived example of using plot() to create a simple line chart.\n\nplot(\n  x = adelie$Sample.Number, \n  y = adelie$Body.Mass..g., \n  type = \"l\", \n  main = \"Body mass vs sample number in Adelie penguins\",\n  xlab = \"Sample Number\",\n  ylab = \"Body Mass (g)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plots are useful for displaying two numeric values against each other. However you’ll often want to compare numeric values across categorical values. One such plot for doing this is called a boxplot. Boxplots show the median and interquartile (IQR) range for a set of data. The ‘whiskers’ of the boxplot display the 1.5 x IQR of the data. We can plot a boxplot of the flipper length for each species using the boxplot() function.\n\nboxplot(\n  Flipper.Length..mm. ~ Species, \n  data = penguins, \n  main = \"Flipper length by species\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot() function is a little funny because it uses formula notation. Many functions in R accept formula notation as input. In this case, the formula notation means “plot the flipper length as a function of the species type”. You may have also noticed that we gave this function the penguins data.frame as the value for the data= argument. This allowed the boxplot function to use the column names without us having to explicitly say that they came from the penguins data.frame.\nIf there’s not too much data, boxplots can actually hide a lot of information. In this case, another option is to use a stripchart. A stripchart shows every data point on the plot instead of a depiction of the distribution as in the boxplot.\n\nstripchart(\n  Flipper.Length..mm. ~ Species, \n  data = penguins, \n  method = \"jitter\",\n  pch = 1,\n  main = \"Flipper length by species\",\n  vertical = TRUE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar charts are another common way that people show summaries of data. To display a barplot of data, we can use the barplot() function. To create a barplot of the mean flipper length for each species we first need to summarize the flipper length for each group and then supply these summaries to the barplot() function.\n\nspecies_means &lt;- tapply(penguins$Flipper.Length..mm., penguins$Species, mean, na.rm = TRUE)\nbarplot(species_means, main = \"Mean flipper length by species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to modify these default plot types and make the charts look great. Take the time to look into some of base R graphing capabilities. A really good tutorial for learning about base R plotting can be found here. Also take a look at ?pairs(), ?dotchart(), and ?coplot() for some other useful base R graphics functions for creating quick plots.\n\n\nFiltering data\nWe’ve already learned how to subset a data.frame but let’s just take a step back and quickly revisit subsetting data.frames. To subset a data.frame means to select rows of a data.frame based on some condition that you’re interested in. This subsetting can be accomplished using the [ operator and setting conditions by specifying df[the rows we want, the cols we want] syntax.\nFor example, in the above plots it looked like the Gentoo penguins typically had the largest flippers. It looked like a value &gt; 205 roughly separated the Gentoo penguins from the others. How could we select the rows where the flipper length is greater than or equal to 205 and count the species types?\n\nbig_flippers &lt;- penguins[penguins$Flipper.Length..mm. &gt;= 205, ]\ntable(big_flippers$Species)\n\n\n      Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) \n                                        3 \nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) \n                                        8 \n        Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) \n                                      122 \n\n\nWe can combine conditions as well to select on multiple conditions. For example, let’s select the female penguins with flippers &gt;= 205 mm.\n\nhead(penguins[penguins$Sex == \"FEMALE\" & penguins$Flipper.Length..mm. &gt;= 205, ])\n\n    studyName Sample.Number                           Species Region Island\nNA       &lt;NA&gt;            NA                              &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;\n153   PAL0708             1 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) Anvers Biscoe\n155   PAL0708             3 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) Anvers Biscoe\n158   PAL0708             6 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) Anvers Biscoe\n159   PAL0708             7 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) Anvers Biscoe\n161   PAL0708             9 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) Anvers Biscoe\n                 Stage Individual.ID Clutch.Completion   Date.Egg\nNA                &lt;NA&gt;          &lt;NA&gt;              &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;\n153 Adult, 1 Egg Stage         N31A1               Yes 2007-11-27\n155 Adult, 1 Egg Stage         N32A1               Yes 2007-11-27\n158 Adult, 1 Egg Stage         N33A2               Yes 2007-11-18\n159 Adult, 1 Egg Stage         N34A1               Yes 2007-11-27\n161 Adult, 1 Egg Stage         N35A1               Yes 2007-11-27\n    Culmen.Length..mm.

Using rownames() is uncommon in workflows from the tidyverse or even data.table. However, rownames() can be very useful when dealing with bioinformatics data. One R package that utilizes rownames() extensively is the SummarizedExperiment. SummarizedExperiments use rownames and colnames to ensure that data stays coordinated during an analysis.\nYou can view and set the rownames() on a data.frame using the rownames() function.\n\n# View the current rownames\nhead(rownames(penguins))\n\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"6\"\n\n# Set the rownames based on a new value - we'll go over what paste() does shortly\nrownames(penguins) &lt;- paste(\"row_number\", 1:nrow(penguins), sep = \".\")\n\n# View the new rownames\nhead(rownames(penguins))\n\n[1] \"row_number.1\" \"row_number.2\" \"row_number.3\" \"row_number.4\" \"row_number.5\"\n[6] \"row_number.6\"\n\n\nAbove, we filtered by a column in the data.frame.

First, to see what columns are in our data.frame we can use the colnames() function.\n\ncolnames(penguins)\n\n [1] \"studyName\"           \"Sample.Number\"       \"Species\"            \n [4] \"Region\"              \"Island\"              \"Stage\"              \n [7] \"Individual.ID\"       \"Clutch.Completion\"   \"Date.Egg\"           \n[10] \"Culmen.Length..mm.\"  \"Culmen.Depth..mm.\"   \"Flipper.Length..mm.\"\n[13] \"Body.Mass..g.\"       \"Sex\"                 \"Delta.15.N..o.oo.\"  \n[16] \"Delta.13.C..o.oo.\"   \"Comments\"           \n\n\nTo select columns, we can either specify the columns we want by name\n\nhead(penguins[, c(\"studyName\", \"Species\")])\n\n             studyName                             Species\nrow_number.1   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.2   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.3   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.4   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.5   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.6   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n\n\nOr by the column index\n\nhead(penguins[, c(1, 3)])\n\n             studyName                             Species\nrow_number.1   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.2   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.3   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.4   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.5   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nrow_number.6   PAL0708 Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\n\n\nIf we want to rename a column, we can use the colnames() function to reassign the column name with a new name. First, we can get the index of the column we want to change. Then we can reassign that column with the new name.\n\n# This returns the index of the colnames() that matches \"Species\"\nwhich_col_to_change &lt;- which(colnames(penguins) == \"Species\")\n\n# Rename \"Species\" to \"species\"\ncolnames(penguins)[which_col_to_change] &lt;- \"species\"\n\nOne tricky aspect of base R subsetting on data.frames has to do with selecting a single column of data. If you select a single column of data from a data.frame what you get back is a vector. To ensure that you return a data.frame when selecting a single column, add the drop=FALSE argument when selecting a single column.\n\n# Returns a vector\nclass(penguins[, \"species\"])\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# Returns a data.frame\nclass(penguins[, \"species\", drop = FALSE])\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\n\n\nModifying columns of data\nAdding or removing columns of data to a data.frame is as simple as specifying the name of the column you want to add along with the data that you want to add.\nFor example, if I wanted to convert the flipper length from mm to m I could multiply each value of flipper length by 0.001.\n\npenguins$flipper_length_m &lt;- penguins$Flipper.Length..mm. * 0.001\n\nThe above data transformation works because of R’s vectorization rule described above. What if I wanted to define a new variable based on a logical condition? For example, what if I wanted to create a new column based on whether or not a penguin was and Adelie or any other kind? A useful function for performing this action is ifelse(). ifelse() evaluates a logical condition and returns a value based on whether the condition evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.\n\npenguins$is_adelie &lt;- ifelse(\n  penguins$species == \"Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\", \n  \"Adelie\", \n  \"Other\"\n  )\n\nIf I want to remove a column from the data.frame I can set the value of the column to NULL\n\npenguins$Flipper.Length..mm. &lt;- NULL",

    "text": "String operations\nString operations are an important part of data cleaning. Base R supports many functions for transforming strings. Again, these string functions are typically vectorized meaning that they can easily be used to modify columns of data.frames.\nThe “species” column of the penguins data.frame is annoying to work with. We can simplify this column by creating simpler names for each species by excluding the scientific name and the word ‘penguin’ (we know they’re all penguins…)\nOne base R function we can use to find and replace text is called gsub(). gsub() takes what is called a regular expression to find text inside of a string and then replaces the text it finds with the text you supply. Regular expressions can become incredibly complex. With this complexity come a lot of power. It would be impossible to teach regular expression in this tutorial. Taking some time to understand the basics of regular expressions can go a long way during data cleaning.\n\n# Replace a space followed by the word 'penguins' and any other character\npenguins$species_clean &lt;- gsub(\n  pattern = \" penguin.*\", \n  replacement = \"\", \n  x = penguins$species, \n  ignore.case = TRUE\n  )\n\n# Show the counts for these new categories\ntable(penguins$species_clean)\n\n\n   Adelie Chinstrap    Gentoo \n      152        68       124 \n\n\nAnother base R function that is useful for extracting text is the substr() function. substr() extracts sub-strings from the supplied text based on the index of the text. For example, to create an even simpler representation of species we could extract only the first letter from the “species” column.\n\npenguins$species_simple &lt;- substr(penguins$species, start = 1, stop = 1)\ntable(penguins$species_simple)\n\n\n  A   C   G \n152  68 124 \n\n\nA slightly more complicated string operation is extracting text from a string. This involves two functions; one to find a match in the text and another to extract it. Let’s say we wanted to extract the word ‘penguin’ from each of the original species strings. We can do this with a combination of regmatches() and regexpr().\n\npenguins$only_penguin &lt;- regmatches(\n  x = penguins$species, \n  m = regexpr(pattern = \"penguin\", \n              text = penguins$species, \n              ignore.case = TRUE)\n  )\n\nR also supports basic operations on strings like making all characters upper or lowercase. For example, to ensure only_penguin contains ‘penguin’ (and not ‘Penguin’) we can convert the string to lowercase\n\n# lower case\nhead(tolower(penguins$only_penguin))\n\n[1] \"penguin\" \"penguin\" \"penguin\" \"penguin\" \"penguin\" \"penguin\"\n\n# or upper case\nhead(toupper(penguins$only_penguin))\n\n[1] \"PENGUIN\" \"PENGUIN\" \"PENGUIN\" \"PENGUIN\" \"PENGUIN\" \"PENGUIN\"\n\n\nAnother slightly complicated string operation is string splitting. String splitting in base R can be accomplished using the strsplit() function. This function is a little tricky because it returns a list. Here, we split the “species” column on every space character. Using the results from the strsplit() function most efficiently involves some advanced R skills.\n\nsplit_species &lt;- strsplit(\n  x = penguins$species, \n  split = \" \"\n  )\n\n# strsplit returns a list of character vectors split on every space\nhead(split_species)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Adelie\"      \"Penguin\"     \"(Pygoscelis\" \"adeliae)\"   \n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Adelie\"      \"Penguin\"     \"(Pygoscelis\" \"adeliae)\"   \n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Adelie\"      \"Penguin\"     \"(Pygoscelis\" \"adeliae)\"   \n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Adelie\"      \"Penguin\"     \"(Pygoscelis\" \"adeliae)\"   \n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Adelie\"      \"Penguin\"     \"(Pygoscelis\" \"adeliae)\"   \n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Adelie\"      \"Penguin\"     \"(Pygoscelis\" \"adeliae)\"   \n\n# To extract the species from this list, we can use a fancy trick\n# don't worry about what's happening here right now\npenguins$extracted_species &lt;- sapply(split_species, `[[`, 1)",

These functions supply abstractions over common for-loops that make applying functions over lists much easier in R.\nThe most commonly used functional programming paradigm in R is the use of the lapply() function. The lapply() function takes a list as input, applies a function to each element of that list, and returns the results as a list. For example, above we split the penguins data.frame into a list of smaller data.frames for each species. Instead of repeating the code to create a histogram from each data.frame, let’s define a function that plots a histogram using a data.frame and then apply that function to every data.frame in our “by_species” list of data.frames\n\n# Define a function for plotting a histogram of flipper lengths\nplot_histogram &lt;- function(df) {\n  hist(df[, \"Flipper.Length..mm.\"], breaks=20)\n}\n\n# Apply this function to every data.frame\n# invisible() is used to hide the output from the hist() function\ninvisible(\n  lapply(X = by_species, FUN = plot_histogram)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR includes some other specialized functions for functional programming.

In this text, Tufte outlines a theory of graphics and provides extensive detail regarding techniques for displaying data that maximizes clarity, precision, and efficiency. Tufte describes graphical excellence by the following points:\nThese points describe how to make good visualizations. However, some visualizations are clearly better than others. Take a look at this presentation by Andrew Gelmen and Antony Unwin. Here, they describe what makes some visualizations effective vs. what makes others ineffective and distracting. I think the main conclusion comes down to design vs decoration. Effective data visualizations are intentionally designed to communicate a point in the clearest possible way. Ineffective visualizations often contain clutter in the form of decorations, unnecessary colors, patterns, lines, and unintuitive use of shapes and sizes.\nOutside of the design choices that go into creating effective visualizations, there are also other expectations required of graphs. The data points should be labelled so that the viewer immediately knows what they’re looking at. The axes should be labelled in a way that’s easy to read and do not distort the message. If using colors, the color palette should augment the visualization in a way that enhances the display of information and not only ‘looks pretty’.\nThere are probably thousands (millions?, infinite?) of types of visualizations in use today. However, in scientific communication, there are basically 5 types of graphs that are most commonly used; line graphs, bar graphs, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts. Most of these have persisted in the literature (with the exception of pie charts) because of their ability to clearly and quickly display visual information about quantitative data. Many other forms of these basic charts exist primarily as variations on a theme but the core display of information remains the same.\nWe’ll use the ggplot2 R package to start creating effective visualizations. ggplot2 works in a way that can feel a little strange at first, especially if you’re used to creating plots in Python with matplotlib, for example. ggplot2 implements ideas from Leland Wilkinson’s, “Grammar of Graphics”. ggplot2, breaks down a graphic into several key components that can be combined in a layered fashion. These core components typically include:\nThe power of this approach lies in its declarative nature. You specify what you want to plot by defining these components, rather than detailing how to draw each element step-by-step (like in matplotlib). This makes it easier to build complex visualizations and to switch between different representations of the same data with minimal changes to the code.",

    "text": "General design guidelines for plots\n\nDon’t use a special color for the background color. Use the same color as your presentation background. Generally, either white or black backgrounds are best\nAxes colors should be high contrast relative to the background. This means black axes on white backgrounds and white axes on black backgrounds.\nUse tick marks that have whole-number intervals. e.g. don’t use axis ticks that are 1.33, 2.75, 3.38, …. Instead, use numbers that people use naturally when counting, e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 2, 4, 6, etc.\nAxes need to be legible. The default font size is often too small. At least 12 point font.\nAxes labels should clearly communicate what is being plotted on each axis. Always show units.\nIf showing a plot title, use the title to tell the user what the conclusion is, not simply describing the data on each axis.\nIf using multiple colors, they should contrast well with each other. Warm colors (reds, yellows) can be used to emphasize selected data.\nKeep colors consistent across graphs. If you use the color “red” to represent treated samples in one plot, use the color “red” in all other plots where the treated samples are present.\nUse colors to communicate. Hues are not emotionally neutral. A good color palette can affect the audience’s perception of the figure (just like a bad one can).\nOnly use gridlines if you need them, most of the time they’re not needed.\nIf using gridlines, be judicious. Their color should be subtle and not obscure the data. Only use grids that matter for the data.\nChoose fonts that are easy to read. sans serif fonts are best. Helvetica or Arial are good default choices\nWhen drawing error bars, don’t make them so wide/large as to obscure the data",

SummarizedExperiments allow you to add and modify the data within the object.\n\nAdding assays\nFor example, we may wish to calculate counts per million values for our counts matrix and add a new assay back into our SummarizedExperiment object.\n\n# Calculate counts per million\ncounts &lt;- assay(se, \"counts\")\ncpm &lt;- counts / colSums(counts) * 1e6\n\n# Add the CPM data as a new assay to our existing se object\nassay(se, \"cpm\") &lt;- cpm\n\n# And if we wish to log-scale these values\nassay(se, \"logcounts\") &lt;- log2(cpm)\n\n# Now there are three assays available\nassays(se)\n\nList of length 3\nnames(3): counts cpm logcounts\n\n\nNote: Instead of creating intermediate variables we could also directly use the assays like so:\n\nassay(se, \"cpm\") &lt;- assay(se, \"counts\") / colSums(assay(se, \"counts\")) * 1e6\n\n\n\nAdding metadata\nSummarizedExperiment objects use the $ to get and set columns of the metadata contained in the colData slot. For example, to get all of the Ages we can use:\n\nse$Age\n\n[1] 44 77 34 67 60 66\n\n\nIf we want to add a new column we simply create the new column in the same way\n\nse$Batch &lt;- factor(rep(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), 2))\n\n# Now you can se that a new 'Batch` column has been added to the colData\ncolData(se)\n\nDataFrame with 6 rows and 4 columns\n         SampleName Treatment       Age    Batch\n        &lt;character&gt;  &lt;factor&gt; &lt;integer&gt; &lt;factor&gt;\nSample1     Sample1 Control          44        A\nSample2     Sample2 Control          77        B\nSample3     Sample3 Control          34        C\nSample4     Sample4 Treatment        67        A\nSample5     Sample5 Treatment        60        B\nSample6     Sample6 Treatment        66        C\n\n\n\n\nAdding rowData\nWe can also modify the data which describes each feature in the matrix by adding columns to the rowData. For example, let’s create a new column called Keep if the gene is a protein_coding gene.\n\nrowData(se)$Keep &lt;- rowData(se)$gene_type == \"protein_coding\"\n\nrowData(se)\n\nDataFrame with 200 rows and 3 columns\n         feature_id      gene_type      Keep\n        &lt;character&gt;    &lt;character&gt; &lt;logical&gt;\nGene1         ID001         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene2         ID002 protein_coding      TRUE\nGene3         ID003 repeat_element     FALSE\nGene4         ID004         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene5         ID005 repeat_element     FALSE\n...             ...            ...       ...\nGene196       ID196         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene197       ID197 protein_coding      TRUE\nGene198       ID198 repeat_element     FALSE\nGene199       ID199         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene200       ID200         lncRNA     FALSE",

    "text": "Subsetting SummarizedExperiment objects\nSummarizedExperiments follow the basic idea of\nse[the rows you want, the columns you want]\nWith a SummarizedExperiment “the rows you want” corresponds to the features in the rows of the matrix/rowData and “the columns you want” corresponds to the metadata in colData\n\nSubsetting based on sample metadata\nFor example, if we want to select all of the data belonging only to samples in the Treatment group we can use the following:\n\n(trt &lt;- se[, se$Treatment == \"Treatment\"])\n\nclass: RangedSummarizedExperiment \ndim: 200 3 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(3): counts cpm logcounts\nrownames(200): Gene1 Gene2 ... Gene199 Gene200\nrowData names(3): feature_id gene_type Keep\ncolnames(3): Sample4 Sample5 Sample6\ncolData names(4): SampleName Treatment Age Batch\n\n\nNotice how the dim of the object changed from 6 to 3. This is because we have selected only the Samples from the original SummarizedExperiment object from the treatment group. The cool thing about SummarizedExperiments is that all of the assays have also been subsetted to reflect this selection!\nTake a look at the “logcounts” assay. It only contains Samples 4, 5, and 6.\n\nassay(trt, \"logcounts\") |&gt; head()\n\n        Sample4  Sample5   Sample6\nGene1 13.311441 11.89383 10.225176\nGene2  9.319622 10.93453  9.256861\nGene3 12.950103 13.83871 10.852010\nGene4 13.349571 12.30126 12.663576\nGene5 11.104882  8.85201 10.893834\nGene6 12.011749 12.18904  9.897059\n\n\nOf course you can combine multiple conditions as well\n\nse[, se$Batch %in% c(\"B\", \"C\") & se$Age &gt; 10]\n\nclass: RangedSummarizedExperiment \ndim: 200 4 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(3): counts cpm logcounts\nrownames(200): Gene1 Gene2 ...

For example to select only the first 50 rows:\n\nse[1:50, ]\n\nclass: RangedSummarizedExperiment \ndim: 50 6 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(3): counts cpm logcounts\nrownames(50): Gene1 Gene2 ... Gene49 Gene50\nrowData names(3): feature_id gene_type Keep\ncolnames(6): Sample1 Sample2 ... Sample5 Sample6\ncolData names(4): SampleName Treatment Age Batch\n\n\nNotice how the dim changed from 200 to 50 reflecting the fact that we have only selected the first 50 rows.\nThis subsetting is very useful when combined with logical operators. Above we created a vector in rowData called “Keep” that contained TRUE if the corresponding row of the se object was a coding gene and FALSE otherwise. Let’s use this vector to subset our se object.\n\n(coding &lt;- se[rowData(se)$Keep, ])\n\nclass: RangedSummarizedExperiment \ndim: 70 6 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(3): counts cpm logcounts\nrownames(70): Gene2 Gene8 ...

Then we can use the GenomicRanges function subsetByOverlaps directly on our SummarizedExperiment object like so:\n\n# Region of interest\nroi &lt;- GRanges(seqnames = \"chr2\", ranges = 1:1e7)\n\n# Subset the SE object for only features on chr2\n(chr2 &lt;- subsetByOverlaps(se, roi))\n\nclass: RangedSummarizedExperiment \ndim: 150 6 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(3): counts cpm logcounts\nrownames(150): Gene51 Gene52 ... Gene199 Gene200\nrowData names(3): feature_id gene_type Keep\ncolnames(6): Sample1 Sample2 ... Sample5 Sample6\ncolData names(4): SampleName Treatment Age Batch\n\n\nYou can see again that the dim changed reflecting our selection. Again, all of the associated assays and rowData have also been subsetted reflecting this change as well.\n\nrowData(chr2)\n\nDataFrame with 150 rows and 3 columns\n         feature_id      gene_type      Keep\n        &lt;character&gt;    &lt;character&gt; &lt;logical&gt;\nGene51        ID051 repeat_element     FALSE\nGene52        ID052         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene53        ID053         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene54        ID054         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene55        ID055 protein_coding      TRUE\n...             ...            ...       ...\nGene196       ID196         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene197       ID197 protein_coding      TRUE\nGene198       ID198 repeat_element     FALSE\nGene199       ID199         lncRNA     FALSE\nGene200       ID200         lncRNA     FALSE\n\n\n\nassay(chr2, \"counts\") |&gt; head()\n\n       Sample1 Sample2 Sample3 Sample4 Sample5 Sample6\nGene51      55     158      32      32      11     126\nGene52      83      65     155      75      54     119\nGene53      70      89      37      81      73     252\nGene54     148     174      12     109      45     130\nGene55      76     106      74     278      55     191\nGene56      89      21      74     161      66     295\n\n\n\nrowRanges(chr2)\n\nGRanges object with 150 ranges and 3 metadata columns:\n          seqnames        ranges strand |  feature_id      gene_type      Keep\n             &lt;Rle&gt;     &lt;IRanges&gt;  &lt;Rle&gt; | &lt;character&gt;    &lt;character&gt; &lt;logical&gt;\n   Gene51     chr2 682015-682114      + |       ID051 repeat_element     FALSE\n   Gene52     chr2 505622-505721      - |       ID052         lncRNA     FALSE\n   Gene53     chr2 572809-572908      + |       ID053         lncRNA     FALSE\n   Gene54     chr2 239876-239975      + |       ID054         lncRNA     FALSE\n   Gene55     chr2 394726-394825      - |       ID055 protein_coding      TRUE\n      ...      ...           ...    ... .         ...            ...       ...\n  Gene196     chr2 253162-253261      - |       ID196         lncRNA     FALSE\n  Gene197     chr2 175394-175493      + |       ID197 protein_coding      TRUE\n  Gene198     chr2 710446-710545      - |       ID198 repeat_element     FALSE\n  Gene199     chr2 901476-901575      + |       ID199         lncRNA     FALSE\n  Gene200     chr2 800990-801089      + |       ID200         lncRNA     FALSE\n  -------\n  seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths\n\n\nThere’s also a few shortcuts on range operations using GRanges/SummarizedExperiments. See the help pages for %over, %within%, and %outside%. For example:\n\nall.equal(se[se %over% roi, ], subsetByOverlaps(se, roi))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nCombining subsetting operations\nOf course you don’t have to perform one subsetting operation at a time. Like base R you can combine multiple expressions to subset a SummarizedExperiment object.\nFor example, to select only features labeled as repeat_elements and the Sample from ‘Batch’ A in the ‘Control’ group\n\n(selected &lt;- se[\n  rowData(se)$gene_type == \"repeat_element\",\n  se$Treatment == \"Control\" &\n    se$Batch == \"A\"\n])\n\nclass: RangedSummarizedExperiment \ndim: 63 1 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(3): counts cpm logcounts\nrownames(63): Gene3 Gene5 ...

    "text": "SummarizedExperiments in the real world\nIf you’re working with any Bioconductor packages it’s likely that the object you’re working with either is a SummarizedExperiment or is inherited from one. For example, the DESeqDataSet from the DESeq2 package and BSseq objects from the bsseq package both inherit from a SummarizedExperiment and thus retain all of the same functionality as above. If you go to the SummarizedExperiment landing page and click “See More” under details you can see all of the packages that depend on SummarizedExperiment.\nAlso, many common methods are also implemented for SummarizedExperiment objects. For example, to simplify calculating counts-per-million above I could have simply used the edgeR::cpm() directly on the SummarizedExperiment object. Many functions in bioconductor packages know how to deal directly with SummarizedExperiments so you don’t ever have to take the trouble extracting components and performing tedious calculations yourself.\n\nassay(se, \"cpm\") &lt;- edgeR::cpm(se)\n\nI also left out any discussion of the metadata() slot of the SummarizedExperiment. The metadata slot is simply a list of any R object that contains information about the experiment. The metadata in the metadata slots are not subjected to the same subsetting rules as the other slots. In practice this assay contains additional information about the experiment as a whole. For example, I typically store bootstrap alignments for each sample here.\nTo add something to the SummarizedExperiment metadata slot you can do:\n\nmetadata(se)$additional_info &lt;- \"Experiment performed on 6 samples with three replicates each\"\n\nAnd to retrieve this:\n\nmetadata(se)$additional_info\n\n[1] \"Experiment performed on 6 samples with three replicates each\"",

    "text": "Assessing global scaling normalization assumptions\nMost downstream differential expression testing methods apply a global scaling normalization factor to each library prior to DE testing. Applying these normalization factors when there are global expression differences can lead to spurious results. In typical experiments this is usually not a problem but when dealing with cancer or epigenetic drug treatment this can actually lead to many problems if not identified.\nIn order to identify potential violations of global scaling normalization I use the quantro R package. quantro uses two data driven approaches to assess the appropriateness of global scaling normalization. The first involves testing if the medians of the distributions differ between groups. These differences could indicate technical or real biological variation. The second test assesses the ratio of between group variability to within group variability using a permutation test similar to an ANOVA. If this value is large, it suggests global adjustment methods might not be appropriate.\n\nlibrary(quantro)\n\n\n# Initialize multiple (8) cores for permutation testing\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel(cores = 8)\n\n# Compute the qstat on the filtered libraries\nqtest &lt;- quantro(y$counts, groupFactor = y$samples$group, B = 500)\n\nNow we can assess the results.

    "section": "Differential expression testing with edgeR",
    "text": "Differential expression testing with edgeR\nAfter removing lowly expressed features and checking the assumptions of normalization we can perform downstream differential expression testing with edgeR. The edgeR manual contains a detailed explanation of all steps involved in differential expression testing.\nIn short, we need to specify the experimental design, estimate normalization factors, fit the models, and perform DE testing.\n\nCreating the experimental design\nMaybe the most important step in DE analysis is properly constructing a design matrix. The details of design matrices are outside of the scope of this tutorial but a good overview can be found here. Generally, your samples will fall nicely into several well defined groups, facilitating the use of a design matrix without an intercept e.g. design ~ model.matrix(~0 + group, ...). This kind of design matrix makes it relatively simple to construct contrasts that describe exactly what pairs of groups you want to compare.\nSince this example experiment is simply comparing treatments to control samples we can model the differences in means by using a model with an intercept where the intercept is the mean of the control samples and the 2nd coefficient represents the differences in the treatment group.\n\n# Model with intercept\ndesign &lt;- model.matrix(~group, data = y$samples)\n\nWe can make an equivalent model and test without an intercept like so:\n\n# A means model\ndesign_no_intercept &lt;- model.matrix(~0 + group, data = y$samples)\n\n# Construct contrasts to test the difference in means between the groups\ncm &lt;- makeContrasts(\n  Treatment_vs_Control = grouptrt - groupuntrt,\n  levels = design_no_intercept\n)\n\nThe choice of which design is up to you. I typically use whatever is clearer for the experiment at hand. In this case, that is the model with an intercept.\n\n\nEstimating normalization factors\nWe use edgeR to calculate trimmed mean of the M-value (TMM) normalization factors for each library.\n\n# Estimate TMM normalization factors\ny &lt;- normLibSizes(y)\n\nWe can check the normalization by creating MA plots for each library. The bulk of the data should be centered on zero without any obvious differences in the logFC as a function of average abundance.\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 4))\nfor (i in 1:ncol(y)) {\n  plotMD(cpm(y, log = TRUE), column = i)\n  abline(h = 0, lty = 2, col = \"red2\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do if global scaling normalization is violated?\nAbove I described testing for violations of global scaling normalization. So what should we do if these assumptions are violated and we don’t have a good set of control genes or spike-ins etc.?\nIf we believe that the differences we are observing are due to true biological phenomena (this is a big assumption) then we can try to apply a method such as smooth quantile normalization to the data using the qsmooth package.\nBelow I will show how to apply qsmooth to our filtered counts and then calculate offsets to be used in downstream DE analysis with edgeR. Please note this is not a benchmarked or ‘official’ workflow just a method that I have implemented based on reading forums and github issues.\n\nlibrary(qsmooth)\n\n\n# Compute the smooth quantile factors \nqs &lt;- qsmooth(y$counts, group_factor = y$samples$group)\n\n# Extract the qsmooth transformed data\nqsd &lt;- qsmoothData(qs)\n\n# Calculate offsets to be used by edgeR in place of norm.factors\n# Offsets are on the natural log scale. Add a small offset to avoid\n# taking logs of zero \noffset &lt;- log(y$counts + 0.1) - log(qsd + 0.1)\n\n# Scale the offsets for internal usage by the DGEList object\n# Now the object is ready for downstream analysis\ny &lt;- scaleOffset(y, offset = offset)\n\n# To create logCPM values with the new norm factors use\nlcpm &lt;- cpm(y, offset = y$offset, log = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nFit the model\nNew in edgeR 4.0 is the ability to estimate dispersions while performing the model fitting step. I typically tend to ‘robustify’ the fit to outliers. Below I will perform dispersion estimation in legacy mode so that we can use competitive gene set testing later. If we want to use the new workflow we can use the following:\n\n# edgeR 4.0 workflow\nfit &lt;- glmQLFit(y, design, legacy = FALSE, robust = TRUE)\n\nWe will continue with the legacy workflow.\n\ny &lt;- estimateDisp(y, design, robust = TRUE)\nfit &lt;- glmQLFit(y, design, robust = TRUE, legacy = TRUE)\n\nIt’s always a good idea at this step to check some of the diagnostic plots from edgeR\n\n# Show the biological coefficient of variation\nplotBCV(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Show the dispersion estimates\nplotQLDisp(fit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest for differential expression\nNow that the models have been fit we can test for differential expression.\n\n# Test the treatment vs control condition\nqlf &lt;- glmQLFTest(fit, coef = 2)\n\nOften it is more biologically relevant to give more weight to higher fold changes. This can be achieved using glmTreat(). NOTE do not use glmQLFTest() and then filter by fold-change - you destroy the FDR correction!\nWhen testing against a fold-change we can use relatively modest values since the fold-change must exceed this threshold before being considered for significance. Values such as log2(1.2) or log2(1.5) work well in practice.\n\ntrt_vs_control_fc &lt;- glmTreat(fit, coef = 2, lfc = log2(1.2))\n\nIn any case, the results of the differential expression test can be extracted to a data.frame for downstream plotting with coriell::edger_to_df(). This function simply returns a data.frame of all results from the differential expression object in the same order as y.

Check out the tutorial for working with SummarizedExperiment objects if you are unfamiliar with their structure.\nThe code below will create a data.frame mapping sample names to file paths containing quantification results. This data.frame is then used by tximeta to import Salmon quantification results at the transcript level (along with transcript annotations).

For example, you can use featureCounts() to count reads over exons, introns, or arbitrary genomic ranges - it’s a very useful tool.\nfeatureCounts() can use an inbuilt annotation or take a user supplied GTF file to count reads over. The inbuilt annotation (NCBI RefSeq) works particularly well with downstream functions implemented in edgeR. See ?Rsubread::featureCounts() for more information about using your own GTF file.\nThe resulting object can also be easily coerced to a DGEList for downstream analysis.\n\nlibrary(Rsubread)\n\n\n# Specify the path to the BAM files produced by STAR\nbam_files &lt;- list.files(\n  path = \"path/to/bam_files\", \n  pattern = \"*.bam$\", \n  full.names = TRUE\n  )\n\n# Optionally name the bam files\nnames(bam_files) &lt;- gsub(\".bam\", \"\", basename(bam_files))\n\n# Count reads over genes for a paired-end library \nfc &lt;- featureCounts(\n  files = bam_files,\n  annot.inbuilt = \"hg38\",\n  isPairedEnd = TRUE,\n  nThreads = 12\n)\n\n# Coerce to DGEList for downstream analysis\ny &lt;- edgeR::featureCounts2DGEList(fc)",

    "section": "Library QC",
    "text": "Library QC\nBefore we perform differential expression analysis it is important to explore the samples’ library distributions to ensure good quality before downstream analysis. There are several diagnostic plots we can use for this purpose implemented in the coriell package. However, first we must remove any features that have too low of counts for meaningful differential expression analysis. This can be achieved using edgeR::filterByExpr().\n\n# Determine which genes have enough counts to keep around\nkeep &lt;- filterByExpr(y)\n\n# Remove the unexpressed genes\ny &lt;- y[keep,,keep.lib.sizes = FALSE]\n\nAt this stage it is often wise to perform library QC on the library size normalized counts. This will give us an idea about potential global expression differences and potential outliers before introducing normalization factors. We can use edgeR to generate log2 counts-per-million values for the retained genes.\n\nlogcounts &lt;- cpm(y, log = TRUE)\n\n\nRelative log-expression boxplots\nThe first diagnostic plot we can look at is a plot of the relative log expression values. RLE plots are good diagnostic tools for evaluating unwanted variation in libraries.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(coriell)\n\n\nplot_boxplot(logcounts, metadata = y$samples, fillBy = \"group\", \n             rle = TRUE, outliers = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Relative Log Expression\",\n       x = NULL,\n       y = \"RLE\",\n       color = \"Treatment Group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the above RLE plot that the samples are centered around zero and have mostly similar distributions. It is also clear that two of the samples, “SRR1039520” and “SRR1039521”, have slightly different distributions than the others.\n\n\nLibrary density plots\nLibrary density plots show the density of reads corresponding to a particular magnitude of counts. Shifts of these curves should align with group differences and generally samples from the same group should have overlapping density curves\n\nplot_density(logcounts, metadata = y$samples, colBy = \"group\") +\n  labs(title = \"Library Densities\",\n       x = \"logCPM\",\n       y = \"Density\",\n       color = \"Treatment Group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample vs Sample Distances\nWe can also calculate the euclidean distance between all pairs of samples and display this on a heatmap. Again, samples from the same group should show smaller distances than sample pairs from differing groups.\n\nplot_dist(logcounts, metadata = y$samples[, \"group\", drop = FALSE])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParallel coordinates plot\nParallel coordinates plots are useful for giving you an idea of how the most variable genes change between treatment groups. These plots show the expression of each gene as a line on the y-axis traced between samples on the x-axis.\n\nplot_parallel(logcounts, y$samples, colBy = \"group\", \n              removeVar = 0.9, alpha = 0.05) +\n  labs(title = \"10% Most Variable Genes\",\n       x = \"Sample\",\n       y = \"logCPM\",\n       color = \"Treatment Group\")\n\nRemoving 90% lowest variance features...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelations between samples\nWe can also plot the pairwise correlations between all samples. These plots can be useful for identifying technical replicates that deviate from the group\n\nplot_cor_pairs(logcounts, cex_labels = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA\nPrincipal components analysis is an unsupervised method for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset while maintaining its fundamental structure. PCA biplots can be used to examine sample groupings following PCA. These biplots can reveal overall patterns of expression as well as potential problematic samples prior to downstream analysis. For simple analyses we expect to see the ‘main’ effect primarily along the first component.\nI like to use the PCAtools package for quickly computing and plotting principal components. For more complicated experiments I have also found UMAP (see coriell::UMAP()) to be useful for dimensionality reduction (although using UMAP is not without its problems for biologists).\n\nlibrary(PCAtools)\n\n\n# Perform PCA on the 20% most variable genes\n# Center and scale the variable after selecting most variable\npca_result &lt;- pca(\n  logcounts, \n  metadata = y$samples, \n  center = TRUE, \n  scale = TRUE, \n  removeVar = 0.8\n  )\n\n# Show the PCA biplot\nbiplot(\n  pca_result, \n  colby = \"group\", \n  hline = 0, \n  vline = 0, \n  hlineType = 2, \n  vlineType = 2, \n  legendPosition = \"bottom\",\n  title = \"PCA\",\n  caption = \"20% Most Variable Features\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing global scaling normalization assumptions\nMost downstream differential expression testing methods apply a global scaling normalization factor to each library prior to DE testing. Applying these normalization factors when there are global expression differences can lead to spurious results. In typical experiments this is usually not a problem but when dealing with cancer or epigenetic drug treatment this can actually lead to many problems if not identified.\nTo identify potential violations of global scaling normalization I use the quantro R package. quantro uses two data driven approaches to assess the appropriateness of global scaling normalization. The first involves testing if the medians of the distributions differ between groups. These differences could indicate technical or real biological variation. The second test assesses the ratio of between group variability to within group variability using a permutation test similar to an ANOVA. If this value is large, it suggests global adjustment methods might not be appropriate.\n\nlibrary(quantro)\n\n\n# Initialize multiple (8) cores for permutation testing\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel(cores = 8)\n\n# Compute the qstat on the filtered libraries\nqtest &lt;- quantro(y$counts, groupFactor = y$samples$group, B = 500)\n\nNow we can assess the results. We can use anova() to test for differences in medians across groups. Here, they do not significantly differ.\n\nanova(qtest)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: objectMedians\n            Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)\ngroupFactor  1  1984.5  1984.5  0.3813 0.5596\nResiduals    6 31225.5  5204.3               \n\n\nWe can also plot the results of the permutation test to see the between:within group ratios. Again, there are no large differences in this dataset suggesting that global scaling normalization such as TMM is appropriate.\n\nquantroPlot(qtest)",

    "text": "Competitive gene set testing with camera()\nI’ve recently become aware of some of the problems with gene set enrichment analysis using the fgsea package. Following Gordon Smyth’s advice, I have switched all of my pipelines to using competitive gene set testing (when appropriate) in limma to avoid problems with correlated genes.\nBelow we use the msigdbr R package to retrieve HALLMARK gene sets and then use edgeR::camera() for gene set testing.\n\nlibrary(msigdbr)\n\n\n# Get the HALLMARK gene set data\nmsigdb_hs &lt;- msigdbr(species = \"Homo sapiens\", category = \"H\")\n\nWarning: The `category` argument of `msigdbr()` is deprecated as of msigdbr 10.0.0.\nℹ Please use the `collection` argument instead.\n\n# Split into list of gene names per HALLMARK pathway\nmsigdb_hs &lt;- split(as.character(msigdb_hs$gene_symbol), msigdb_hs$gs_name)\n\n# Convert the gene sets into lists of indeces for edgeR\nidx &lt;- ids2indices(gene.sets = msigdb_hs, identifiers = y$genes$gene_name)\n\nPerform gene set testing. Note here we can use camera() mroast(), or romer() depending on the hypothesis being tested. The above setup code provides valid input for all of the above functions.\nSee this comment from Aaron Lun describing the difference between camera() and roast(). For GSEA like hypothesis we can use romer()\n\nroast() performs a self-contained gene set test, where it looks for any DE within the set of genes. camera() performs a competitive gene set test, where it compares the DE within the gene set to the DE outside of the gene set.\n\n\n# Use camera to perform competitive gene set testing\ncamera_result &lt;- camera(y, idx, design, contrast = 2)\n\n# Use mroast for rotational gene set testing - bump up number of rotations\nmroast_result &lt;- mroast(y, idx, design, contrast = 2, nrot = 1e4)\n\n# Use romer for GSEA like hypothesis testing\nromer_result &lt;- romer(y, idx, design, contrast = 2)\n\nWe can also perform a pre-ranked version of the camera test using cameraPR(). To use the pre-ranked version we need to create a ranking statistic. The suggestion from Gordon Smyth is to derive a z-statistic from the F-scores like so:\n\nt_stat &lt;- sign(de_result$logFC) * sqrt(de_result$`F`)\nz &lt;- zscoreT(t_stat, df = qlf$df.total)\n\n# Name the stat vector with the gene names \nnames(z) &lt;- de_result$gene_name\n\n# Use the z-scores as the ranking stat for cameraPR\ncamera_pr_result &lt;- cameraPR(z, idx)\n\nAnother useful plot to show following gene set testing is a barcodeplot. We The barcodeplot displays the enrichment of a given signature for a ranked list of genes. The limma::barcodeplot() function allows us to easily create these plots for any of the gene sets of interest using any ranking stat of our choice.\n\n# Show barcodeplot using the z-scores\nbarcodeplot(\n  z, \n  index = idx[[\"HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE\"]], \n  main = \"HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE\",\n  xlab = \"z-score\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Or you can use the logFC\nbarcodeplot(\n  de_result$logFC, \n  index = idx[[\"HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE\"]], \n  main = \"HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE\",\n  xlab = \"logFC\"\n  )",

    "text": "General tips\nA science presentation is more than just displaying your results on a slide deck. Good content doesn’t speak for itself. A good science presentation is more like a story that weaves together a problem (gap in knowledge), a logical thought process for solving that problem (hypothesis), data that supports your claims (figures), and a compelling delivery. The structure of your presentation, the design of the slides, the flow of information from one slide to the next, and your delivery of that information, are all aspects that your need to consider if you want to create informative and interesting presentations. Like everything else in life, this takes time and practice. Below are a few tips that I have learned. For a good book on this topic check out Designing Science Presentations by Matt Carter.",

    "text": "Keep it simple. Well designed presentations translate complex information into simple messages. Richard Feyman was famous for this ability.\nSubtract! It’s easy to keep adding information, text, images, etc. to a presentation. It’s much harder to know what information to take away. Generally, try to deliberately take away any elements of your presentation that don’t add value. Simple is not boring, it’s focused.\nYour presentation is about the audience. Determine who your audience is and what they are likely to know or not know. Design all aspects of your presentation with this in mind.\nLearn some principles of design and apply them to your presentations. Design is not decoration. Collect examples of good presentations and take notes from people who do it well.\nColor is a powerful tool for communication. Intentional color choices can draw attention to important data, emphasize points, and evoke emotions. Poorly chosen colors can be distracting and make your content unreadable\nFont choices matter. Fonts can convey tone and personality. Use a font that increases readability. Use italics or bolding to emphasize important ideas.\nWords matter. Choose words that express your ideas precisely, concisely, and as clearly as possible.\nThere’s no correct number of slides. It comes down to your presentation and delivery.\nEverything doesn’t need to be shown - sometimes the best way of communicating an idea is by narration alone.",

    "text": "Slide presentation tips\nGenerally, you’ll want to design a slide presentation in a way that focuses on overall ideas rather than just moving from one slide to the next. Think about the structure of your presentation. This generally means following the scientific method.\nFor your internship presentations, the structure can be something like:\n\nIntroduction / background\n\nWhat is the context and why should we care about it?.\n\nWhat does the audience need to know in order to understand your conclusions later?\nImportantly, lead the audience in understanding the gap in knowledge. What problem are you trying to solve?. Clearly emphasize your goal.\nThink about the introduction like a funnel. Start with a broad topic and then narrow in on your what your focus will be for the remainder of the presentation. General –&gt; Specific.\n\nExperimental methods\n\nClearly explain how you’re going to solve the problem. What data you used, and what methods.\nExplain why you chose the methods you did and how they answer parts of your overall hypothesis.\nDon’t forget to mention the things that your methods lack.\n\nResults\n\nTake the audience through your data step-by-step, starting with the simplest results and building into more complex ideas.\nDon’t show too much on one slide. One (or two) figures is usually all you need.\nDon’t put anything on a slide that you aren’t going to discuss.\nExplain your figures if you put it on the slide, explain it. Tell the audience what the graph is showing, explain to them the conclusions you draw from it.\nBe sure to connect your data to the larger story of your presentation - how does this data relate to the information you talked about earlier?\n\nDiscussion / conclusions\n\nSpecific –&gt; General\nRecap the original problem.\nRecap your methods and why they are appropriate to solve this problem.\nPull out the main points and emphasize them. Tell the audience why they are important.\nMention any gaps or future work.\nConclude on broader implications.\n\n\nIn addition to this structure, sometimes it’s good to include some measure of progress in the form of slide numbers or a “home” slide - a slide that you come back to that is used to orient the audience to their place in the presentation.\n\nExample\nHere is a link to my PhD proposal slides presentation. I tried to incorporate good design principles when creating this. While it’s certainly not perfect and I’m certainly not the best presenter, here are a few of the design choices I tried to make to improve the presentation.\n\nslide 1: eye-catching background with presenter information in contrasting white font. Note that the same font is used throughout the presentation.\nslide 2: High contrast slides, modern black font (Helvetica Neue) on white inconspicuous background. Relatively few words on the slide. Give the audience an idea of the structure of the presentation.\nslide 3: Section header slide used to orient the audience. Section headers can be a good way to give structure to a presentation.\nslides 4-8: General information to specific problem. What are TEs? Why are they important for cancer? How do they contribute to immunotherapy response? Why is this difficult to study? General –&gt; Specific.\nslide 9: An entire slide dedicated to emphasizing the main point of the rest of the proposal.\nslide 11: The use of bolding in the bullet points to emphasize the main point of each. Layout of the slide is designed as question on the left and answer on the right in italics.\nslide 17-16: Results slides showing limited number of figures on each slide with clear data and axes labels. Each title reflects what I want the audience to take away from the figures.\nslide 22: Use color to emphasize the main paper of interest.\nslide 23: Repeat the question and answer structure\nslide 39: Conclusions recap the entire proposal. Bold text is used to emphasize where this proposal falls into the overall scientific goals.",
